# 1 - Task: Working with Git

 - 1. Use Unix operation system (Mac OS or Ubuntu) [for now, this task is optional, but future you need it].
 - 2. Install Git and Node JS ( https://nodejs.org/en/ )
 - 3. Create profile on github.com (if you have already profile, it is okay, use this).
 - 4. Create new repository called - hello_nodejs
 - 5. Clone your repository on your computer - 
git clone [repo_url]

 - 6. Write simple Hello World App using Express JS ( https://expressjs.com/ )

Main page (localhost:3000/) says - Hello Node JS. It is my first App(H1 Tag)
About page (localhost:3000/about) - Write your name and email (P tag)

Create .ignore file on main folder, write node_modules [This prevents to push node_modules folder which is not necessary]

Run you on localhost, if everything okay, commit your code by doing:
1. git add .
2. git commit -m "It is my repository"
3. git push origin master

 - 7. After that send your repository in group.
